        <h1>IMPACT OF CI</h1><br/>
        <p>
          Hearing impairment has a significant impact on the child and his
          family. This impact is seen on every aspect of life including
          cognitive, communication, psychosocial, educational, and personality
          development as well as on financial condition of the family.
          Considering the wide ranging impact of hearing impairment early
          identification and intervention during the critical learning years,
          has been found to be very important to minimize the impact of the
          hearing impairment in the child’s over all development.

          With the recent advances in hearing technology including cochlear
          implants, children with severe to profound hearing loss have access to
          most of the sound of spoken language. Most of children who are born
          deaf of hard of hearing can learn to listen to their own voices,
          listen to the voices of others and listen to the sounds of life.

          It is important to know about impact of cochlear implants in young
          children as it involves high cost, surgery, and a high level of family
          expectations. Factors including age at onset of deafness, age at
          implantation, amount of cochlear implant experience, and educational
          training determine the overall benefits a child will have post
          cochlear implantation. Following sections will highlight the various
          impacts on the children’s lives post implantation of cochlear
          implants.

        <h3>Auditory skills</h3><br/>

        <p>
          Children with cochlear implants achieve performance levels that
          exceeded those of their non-implanted peers who used other sensory
          aids, including conventional hearing aids and vibrotactile aids.2 The
          improvement of hearing in terms of purely audiological performance is
          remarkable: audiological tests including monosyllabic word and
          sentences tests show a noticeable increase in open word recognition
          after implantation of cochlear implants3. The improved auditory skills
          enhance the opportunity for acquisition of speech and language.
